## Description
I was motivated to make this project to help web developers create READMEs more efficiently.
My reasoning for this assignment was to make an easier, faster, and more detailed README.
The issue with writing READMEs is that new developers (like myself) may not know how to write a README correctly. This application is to help with that issue.
I learned how to create a README file by using node.js
